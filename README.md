# HBV GWS project

## Project structure

* Statistics notebook: put altogether all relevant information about statistical theoretical background
* Clinical data notebook: easy and light-weight data (don't forget to delete once SCITAS works)
* Plink introduction notebook: basic procedures and commands of plink. Mainly follows the official tutorial 
* Plink and Python notebook: how to import plink files into python (not used it now, I guess I'll mainly import plink outputs in Python)
* tutorial/HapMap notebook: processing example data (official tutorial)

## TO DO / OPTIMIZE:

* **Find a way to manage paths **
* Assemble scripts together ?
* Make a kind of setup file (python, bash, both ???)
* Manage figure storage (some kind of option at beggining of the notebook, or make it separately again ??)

If more time:
* Look at makefiles
