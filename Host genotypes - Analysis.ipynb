    "At this point, we expect to have **clean** viral and host data (filtered for missingness, rare variants, hardy-weinberg equilibrium). We will first filter out the individuals that are missing in any of the three datasets (viral sequencing data, host sequencing data, clinical data) by using a custom function `common.find_individuals`. Then we will run some PCAs and association tests (univariate and multivariate models, i.e. corrected for sex, age, population stratification, ...). Eventually, we'll focus on asian individuals."
